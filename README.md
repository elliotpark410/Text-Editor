# Text-Editor
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A text editor app that runs in the browser and meets the Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria. It includes a couple of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Getting Started

To begin the application, use the following in command line:

`
npm run start
`

Next, you can enter [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser of your choice

<br>


## Installation

To run this application, you will need Node and other dependencies: 

1. You will need to install Node.js. Here is a link below:

[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

<br>

2. Once you have downloaded Node.js, you will want to download node package manager (npm). In command line, you can enter:

`npm install -g npm
`

<br>

3. Next, clone the repository and install all the dependencies in the package.json. In command line, you can enter:

`npm install 
`

<br>


## Usage

To run this application, click on [Deployed App on Heroku](https://pure-chamber-15361.herokuapp.com/). Additionally, there is an "install" button in the app which will allow you to use the app while offline

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


<!-- ## Test-Instructions

To test the API, I recommend downloading [Insomnia's API Platform](https://insomnia.rest/) and enter the following in Insomnia's URL:

>GET http://localhost:3000/api/notes

<br>

>POST http://localhost:3000/api/notes

Example POST body: 
```bash
{
  "title":"Notes Title",
  "text":"notes text content"
}
```
*id is automatically generated so you do not need to enter id

<br>
<br>

>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/:id

<br>

Example DELETE: The API request below will delete note with id = "1"
>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/1

<br> -->

## Code Snippets

This code snippet shows how you set up IndexedDB for data persistence 

* Indexed Database API is a JavaScript application programming interface provided by web browsers for managing a NoSQL database of JSON objects

* Import the 'idb' package to use with IndexedDB.

* Create a function that can be used to start up the database

`
const initdb = async () =>
`

* Create a database named 'jate' and we will use version 1

`
openDB('jate', 1, {
`

* Sets the database schema if it isn't already defined with 

`
upgrade(db)
`

* Create an object store for our data inside of 'jate' db and a key named 'id' which will automatically be incremented

`
db.createObjectStore('jate', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
`

```
import { openDB } from 'idb';

const initdb = async () =>
  openDB('jate', 1, {
    upgrade(db) {
      if (db.objectStoreNames.contains('jate')) {
        console.log('jate database already exists');
        return;
      }
      db.createObjectStore('jate', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
      console.log('jate database created');
    },
  });
```

## Learning Points

* How to deploy app to Heroku

* How to use IndexedDB for data persistence

* How to use Webpack (aka module bundler) to compile JavaScript modules 

* How to create a service worker to allow apps to continue functioning offline
