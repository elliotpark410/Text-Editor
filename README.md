# Text-Editor
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A text editor app that runs in the browser and meets the Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria. It includes a couple of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

OLD README.MD MUST UPDATE!!!

## Getting Started

To begin the application, use the following in command line:

`
nodemon index.js
`
<br>


## Installation

To run this application, you will need Node and other dependencies: 

1. You will need to install Node.js. Here is a link below:

[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

<br>

2. Once you have downloaded Node.js, you will want to download node package manager (npm). In command line, you can enter:

`npm install -g npm
`

<br>

3. Next, install all the dependencies in the package.json. In command line, you can enter:

`npm install 
`

4. Additionally, you can download MongoDB database to store and access data:

[Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

<br>


5. Lastly, you will need to download Insomnia for testing API routes:

[Download Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)

<br>


<!-- ## Prerequisites
Requires node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest (optional)

<br> -->


<!-- ## Test-Instructions

To test the API, I recommend downloading [Insomnia's API Platform](https://insomnia.rest/) and enter the following in Insomnia's URL:

>GET http://localhost:3000/api/notes

<br>

>POST http://localhost:3000/api/notes

Example POST body: 
```bash
{
  "title":"Notes Title",
  "text":"notes text content"
}
```
*id is automatically generated so you do not need to enter id

<br>
<br>

>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/:id

<br>

Example DELETE: The API request below will delete note with id = "1"
>DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/notes/1

<br> -->

Insomnia: Get Route request to retrieve All Users with Thoughts and Reactions

<br>

## Code Snippets

This code snippet shows how you can use Express routes and Mongoose ORM to create controllers for a Reactions (i.e. comments) delete route

* findOneAndUpdate() function in Mongoose finds the first document that matches a given filter, applies an update, and returns the document 

* The filter we give findOneAndUpdate is "{_id: req.params.thoughtId}". For this app, the user includes the req.params.thoughtId in the URL

* $pull operator is used to remove all instances of a value from an existing array. In this case, we are going into a nested object to retrieve "req.params.reactionId"

* {new: true} will have the findOneAndUpdate() function return the object after the update was applied. The default is to return the object before the update was applied

* You'll notice a "?" and the following line has a ":" which is a ternary oeprator and has the form of "condition ? value-if-true : value-if-false"

```
  deleteReaction(req, res) {
    Thought.findOneAndUpdate(
      { _id: req.params.thoughtId },
      { $pull: { reactions: { reactionId: req.params.reactionId } } },
      {new: true})
      .then((thoughtData) =>
        !thoughtData
          ? res.status(404).json({ message: 'No thought found with that ID.' })
          : res.json(thoughtData)
      )
      .catch((err) => res.status(500).json(err));
  },
```
